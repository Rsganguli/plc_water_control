The ride full with tour group is sensed by ‘cart detect’ limit switch. The water tank is associated with two solenoid operated valve and corresponding level sensor. The ‘filling valve’, accompanied by ‘level full sensor’, is at the top end of the water tank whereas the ‘outlet valve’, accompanied by ‘level empty sensor’, is at the bottom of the water tank.
